# rotating-sprite
Python class for rotating sprites

# info
I wanted to make Python games with rotating sprites, so I made this. It's not a perfect solution; it moves wierdly when it moves slowly.
It works pretty well though.

Made with Python 3.8.6 Pygame 2.0.1. I don't think it'll work in Python 2+, but I'm willing to be proved wrong.

What else am I supposed to say in the README?
